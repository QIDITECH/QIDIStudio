[hint: Single-Material Only]
text = Single-Material Only\nHelio currently simulates one material and one nozzle per job. Multi-material or multi-extruder G-code adds long pauses that break thermal continuity, so results wouldn’t be meaningful.

[hint: One Plate per Job]
text = One Plate per Job\nUpload G-code with a single build plate—multi-plate projects aren’t yet supported, so only the first plate would run.

[hint: What is the Thermal Quality Index?]
text = What is the Thermal Quality Index?\nThe Thermal Quality Index (scale –100 to +100) shows how hot or cold each region prints—green (≈ 0) is the “just right” zone for strong, warp-free parts. Keep most of the part green for best results.

[hint: Voxel-Level Accuracy]
text = Voxel-Level Accuracy\nWe predict temperature in every voxel at every time-step, and for standard jobs the forecast is typically within ±5–10 °C. Pauses, custom firmware or odd cooling can widen that margin.

[hint: Fan & Airflow Model]
text = Fan & Airflow Model\nA simplified fan-and-room model shows how cooling settings change part temps without slow CFD maths—great for day-to-day tuning. Chamber vortices aren’t yet simulated so runs stay fast.

[hint: TQI Limits Explained]
text = TQI Limits Explained\n-100 → too cold: tensile strength is ~50 % lower than parts printed at the ideal 0 (ASTM D638 dog-bone tests). +100 → too hot: layers stay molten and may sag or collapse. Keep regions near 0 for peak strength and accuracy.

[hint: What Drives Runtime?]
text = What Drives Runtime?\nExtra layers, dense infill, lots of tiny arcs (small mesh elements) or very slow printing speeds all extend simulation time because the solver must step through more seconds. Multi-core CPUs or CUDA GPUs speed things up.

[hint: Nozzle Temp Range]
text = Nozzle Temp Range\nSupported set-points are 190 – 320 °C; anything outside is clamped to keep physics realistic.

[hint: Why Cooling Varies]
text = Why Cooling Varies\nOuter walls and bridges cool fastest while thick interiors stay warmer—geometry, airflow and tool-path all play a part, and the simulation visualises these differences.

[hint: Extrusion Temp Model]
text = Extrusion Temp Model\nMaterial properties shape the melt curve, but printer geometry decides how much heat the filament actually gains, so the model is material-specific and printer-calibrated.

[hint: Nozzle setting of 190 °C vs 320 °C?]
text = Nozzle setting of 190 °C vs 320 °C?\nA 100 °C nozzle change only nudges the thermal index because extrusion temp, flow rate and post-deposition cooling dominate the part’s heat history.
